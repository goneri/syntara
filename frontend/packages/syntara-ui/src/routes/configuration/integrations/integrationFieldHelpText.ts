export const INTEGRATION_TYPE_HELP =
  'Registers a connection to an external service. MCP servers expose tools for agent workflows. LLM providers supply models. Automation platform integrations verify gateway connectivity. OpenShift integrations register cluster connections.'

export const NAME_HELP =
  'A unique name that identifies this integration. Use a name that describes the service or environment, such as "Production MCP" or "Dev LLM Gateway."'

export const PROVIDER_TYPE_HELP =
  'Pre-configured defaults for known LLM providers. Some providers use a fixed API base URL; others require you to enter one. Custom always requires a base URL.'

export const API_URL_HELP =
  'Admin-managed connection endpoint. For MCP servers, the MCP server URL. For LLM providers, the API base URL used to reach the provider.'

export const AAP_URL_HELP =
  'Base URL of the automation platform gateway. Health checks call GET /api/gateway/v1/me/ to confirm reachability and that the management credential is valid.'

export const SCOPE_HELP =
  'When Global is enabled, this integration is available to workflows in every project. When Global is off, only the selected projects can use it.'

  'Projects that may use this integration. Resources belong to a single project; a project-scoped integration is only available when working in those projects.'

export const HEALTH_CHECK_CREDENTIAL_HELP =
  'Management credential used for health checks, connection testing, and resource discovery only. Workflow nodes use separate execution credentials configured per integration when a workflow runs.'

export const OPENSHIFT_URL_HELP =
  'HTTPS URL of the OpenShift Kubernetes API, such as https://api.example.com:6443. Include only the hostname and optional port. TLS certificate verification is required; provide a CA certificate for clusters using a private CA.'

  'An HTTP Bearer Token credential for the OpenShift API. Connection testing confirms the authenticated identity; it does not check namespace access or workload permissions.'
